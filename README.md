A beginning on Github

Hi,

jpdwalsh here, I have an interest in Perl, Python and Jave. Currenlty using Perl and Python regularly at work but not much time for Java. I created a Github presence to practice some of my code here, to help me get back into the coding process.

Baked Potatoe shops are the future.
